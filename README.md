# Food-ordering-Macd-
🍔 McDonald's Billing System (C++)

A console-based food ordering and billing system inspired by McDonald's.
This project is built using C++ and demonstrates basic programming concepts like loops, arrays, switch-case, and billing calculations.

📌 About The Project

This project simulates a fast-food ordering system where users can:

Select food items from menu

Choose size and type

Add add-ons (Peri Peri)

Enter quantity

Generate final bill with tax and discount

It is a menu-driven console application.

🍟 Menu Items

Burger (Veg ₹250 / Non-Veg ₹280)

Fries (Medium ₹100 / Large ₹150)

Peri Peri Add-on (+₹30)

Coke (Medium ₹90 / Large ₹120)

McFlurry (₹220)

🧮 Billing Logic

Tax = 5% of subtotal

Discount = 10% of subtotal

Final Bill = Subtotal + Tax − Discount

🛠️ Technologies Used

C++

Arrays

While Loop

Switch Case

If-Else

String Handling

🚀 How To Run
🔹 Using g++
g++ main.cpp -o billing
./billing
🔹 Using VS Code / CodeBlocks

Open main.cpp

Click Run

Follow console instructions

🖥️ Sample Output
=========== BILL ===========
Veg Burger x2  ₹500
Fries (Large + Peri Peri) x1  ₹180
----------------------------
Subtotal : ₹680
Tax (5%) : ₹34
Discount : ₹68
Final Bill: ₹646
📚 What We Learned
